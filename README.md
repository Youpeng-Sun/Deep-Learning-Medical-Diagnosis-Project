# Deep-Learning-Medical-Diagnosis-Project

Project Name: X-ray Medical Diagnosis Software

Version: 1.0

Core Function

AI-based chest X-ray diagnosis (binary classification only: Pneumothorax vs Normal)

Programming Language

Python

Main Libraries

PyTorch

OpenCV

PyQt6

Additional Libraries

NumPy, Pandas, sqlite3, argparse, sys, pydicom, PIL, os, shutil, torchvision, matplotlib, efficientnet_pytorch

Usage Instructions
1. Installation

Extract the project folder (ensure sufficient disk space for image storage).

Install the required Python packages in a virtual environment.

2. Running the Application

Run main.py.

A patient information table will appear.

Click Add or Batch Import to upload .dicom files (only DICOM format is supported).

3. Viewing and Diagnosis

After successful import, select any cell in the table and click View Image to access the corresponding record.

This will open the diagnosis interface.

The X-ray image can be zoomed in and out freely.

Click Toggle Heatmap to display the AI-generated activation map.

Click Doctor Notes to leave comments.

Additional Notes

Imported DICOM files and generated PNG images are automatically saved in the extracted project directory under the following path format:

ROOT/Images/PatientName_ID/ExaminationDate/DicomUID/


Patient information is automatically stored in a local SQLite database (database.db) located in the same project folder.

Note: The UI displays only part of the database information.

The Delete option in the main table interface removes:

The selected row in the UI

All locally stored images

The corresponding database records

Diagnosis results are shown in the Diagnosis column in the main information table.

On the second-page diagnosis interface:

Except for the heatmap, all other diagnostic information shown is sample content and not generated by the AI model.

The heatmap has limited precision and should be interpreted with caution.
